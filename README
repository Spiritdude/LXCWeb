This is a web-interface for LXC (LinuX Container) with some helpers (/etc/init.d/lxcweb and lxcfarm).

It's an ALPHA release:

what works:
- create, clone, start, freeze, unfreeze and stop containers via web-interface
- see details of the containers
- auto-start containers at boot time when host starts
- halt and reboot host (and all containers therein)

read INSTALL for more details.

what doesn't works:
- configure virtual network (br0), for now it's DHCP; each container a DHCP-client (dynamic IP allocation)
- static IP for containers
- disk-usage info per container
- there is no authentication, whoever has access to the host, can access LXCWeb
- there is little to no security audit done _yet_ - so you likely can use the web-interface to do more things than just handle LXC but likely take over the entire machine
