Running full farm, e.g. over 20 lxc containers you can use lxcfarm script.

Create a base system:
   % sudo ./lxcfarm create -t ubuntu ubu00
   
then start it, configure it properly and then leave and stop it again.

Then create 40x clones of it:
   % sudo ./lxcfarm create -o ubu00 ubu01..40

and start them
   % sudo ./lxcfarm start ubu01..40 

and get an overview
   % lxcfarm info 

or particular ones
   % lxcfarm info ubu01..20 ubu33..35 ubu40


==SSH Host & Container==

on the host:
   % sudo su
   % ssh-keygen
   % mkdir /var/lib/lxc/ubu01/rootfs/root/.ssh

share the public-key direct into the directory of the lxc container(s), e.g. 
   % cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /var/lib/lxc/ubu01/rootfs/root/.ssh/authorized_keys

recreating ssh keys (private & public) in the container(s):
   % rm -f /ec/ssh/ssh_host_*
   % dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
